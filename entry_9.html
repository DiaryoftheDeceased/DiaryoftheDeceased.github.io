    <h2>Entry 9</h2> <h3>4•15•2024•1:47am</h3>

    <p>This day was oddly joyous.</p>
    <p>I was challenged</p>
    <p>As well, gained a mortal foe.</p>
    <p>The Mighty Duck.</p>
    <p>Do not ever offer your back to foe.</p>
    <p>It attacked.</p>
    <p>I fled.</p>
    <p>Only for me to return with risk and defense.</p>
    <p>I embodied bravery to guide me.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There were children near.</p>
    <p>In need of their plaything.</p>
    <p>They were then first priority.</p> 
    <p>Me and defense stood against the Mighty Duck.</p>   
    <p>With Risk and bravery at our sides.</p>
    <p>The Mighty Duck had backed down.</p>
    <p>We welcomed vitory</p> 
    <p>And took home few battle scars.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I understood the attack.</p>
    <p>The Mighty Duck was to be a father.</p>
    <p>In the face of danger I laughed and was unbothered.</p>
    <p>It displays how I have surpassed and grown.</p>
