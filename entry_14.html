    <h2>Entry 14</h2> <h3>4•22•2024•1:01am</h3>

    <p>I am not locked up.</p>
    <p>Yet feels like I am.</p>
    <p>Eventually I will need to rid my unwanted visitor.</p>
    <p>Till' then; I sit in my castle.</p>
    <p>I have faced Panic before.</p>
    <p>Though, at the time, I had help.</p>
    <p>I just so happen to be where the Heliotropes are.</p>
    <p>Succumbing to Panic</p>
    <p>Asking for help</p>
    <p>All makes me feel like a hopeless child.</p>
    <p>Thought is right.</p>
    <P>I will become weak if I let Panic take over what is mine.</p>
