    <h2>Entry 3</h2> <h3>3•29•2024•2:27am</h3>

    <p>Since spring has met my acquaintance.</p>
    <p>A lot of other things have become acquainted with me</p>
    
    <p>I am befriending another tongue.</p>
    <p>I am exploring sound with the body.</p>
    
    <p>I am peeking at garments that pleases my eye.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, I felt emotion.</p>
       
    <p>The feminine energy danced its way into the castle.</p>
    <p>How elegant and true she is.</p>
    
    <p>It felt real. I feel life.</p> 
    
    <p>Oh how I wish I had reconciled with myself earlier.</p>
