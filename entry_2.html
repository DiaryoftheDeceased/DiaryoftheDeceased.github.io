    <p>Just as peace arrived, so did spring</p>
    <p>And with her a new year</p>
    
    <p>I could feel her in the ending months as I can now.</p>
    <p>Beautiful she is, yet I want winter back.</p>
    
    <p>The safe feeling of the dead trees and cold.</p>
    <p>I age another year. One more until I am out of my youth.</p>
       
    <p>Good. I would like to leave my youth as dead as I.</p>
    <p>I shall dance in the castle along with the spirits.</p>
    
    <p>A start I am eager to see.</p> 
    
    <p>Hmm, what will I do next?</p>
