    <h2>Entry 21</h2> <h3>4•29•2024•2:07am.</h3>

    <p>I, this day, did not need to write.</p>
    <p>Though I am writing.p>
    <p>I had converse with thought.</p>
    <p>(Mara is still following me like a child without its mother I may tell.)</p>
    <p>After Panic’s servant took her leave.</p>
    <p>This place.</p>
    <p>My home</p>
    <p>I question plethora.</p>
    <p>At times,</p> 
    <p>I do wish another was here.</p>   
    <p>Alive and formed.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is pointless to want this.</p>
    <p>This land does not know of warmth.</p>
    <p>Nothing does not ever properly form here.</p>
    <p>I am beginning to think nothing ever will.</p>
