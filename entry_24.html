    <h2>Entry 24</h2> <h3>5•5•2024•6:45am</h3>

    <p>I awaken from slumber.</p>
    <p>Mara being a paralysis demon above me.</p>
    <p>I resist the urge to shoo her away.</p>
    <p>I am preoccupied with finding thought.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“You went to the Cosmos.”</p>
    <p>I do not have the time.</p>
    <p>“I see your anger has ceased.”</p>
    <p>I eye her closely.</p>
    <p>I may not like her at this moment.</p>
    <p>But she is correct.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Did you see anything?” She questions.</p>
    <p>“There is no point in asking;</p>
    <p>For you already have the truth.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Tell me. So it can ring true.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I tell her of the Cosmos.</p>
    <p>How beautiful it is.</p>
    <p>How I seen my friendly stranger.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>   
    <p>She grimaces at the mention of another.</p>
    <p>Them-Him specifically.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“I find it incredibly odd, how blue and clear the sky was.</p>
    <p>As well as the buildings; All abandoned; Apocalyptic even”</p>
    <p>“I am curious of his conversation with thought at that very moment.”</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I look up to see Mara very angry.</p>
    <p>Her eyes focused on my arm.</p>
    <p>I look down to see an opaque white aqueous.</p>
    <p>My cracks are breaking.</p>
    <p>And I am bleeding.</p>
