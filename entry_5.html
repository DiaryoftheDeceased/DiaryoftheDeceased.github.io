    <p>The silhouettes are still here.</p>
    <p>They are relentless.</p>
    
    <p>I was well.</p>
    <p>I am well.</p>
    
    <p>Strong mind is key.</p>
    <p>I will preserve.</p>
       
    <p>Let me look at the good.</p>
    <p>My family and I shared laughs today.</p>
    <p>I . . . have, I think I have a friend: it's very unclear these days.</p> 
    <p>Looking at garments soon to be mine is good.</p>
    <p>I like doing that. It's becoming my favorite pastime.</p>   
    <p>I am great as well.</p>

    <p>This is a good route.</p>
    <p>Let me stay on this route.</p>
    
    <p>I am going to be alright.</p>
    <p>I hope.</p>
    <p>I will be alright.</p>
