    <h2>Entry 13</h2> <h3>4•21•2024•2:17am</h3>

    <p>I can not leave the castle yet.</p>
    <p>Panic’s servant still walks.</p>
    <p>So I shall stay put.</p>
    <p>My thoughts and I converse.</p>
    <p>We talk about all sorts.</p>
    <p>This realm.</p>
    <p>Famille.</p>
    <p>My friendly Stranger.</p>
    <p>I encourage thought not to overthink.</p>
    <p>I speak rather calmly to her.</p>
    <P>She asks specifically.</p>
    <p>She tells:</p>
    <p>“What is to become of you, if a mere servant is preventing you from leaving the very place you have created?”</p>
    <p>( … )</p>
    <p>I can only offer her a blank stare and silence.</p>
    <p>Thought had created an epiphany.</p>
    <p>And gifted it to me.</p>
    <p>For she is clever.</p>
