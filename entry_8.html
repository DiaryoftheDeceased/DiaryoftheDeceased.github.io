    <h2>Entry 8</h2> <h3>4•14•2024•3:15am</h3>

    <p>I am writing this out.</p>
    <p>‘Fore my mind and forget become acquaintances.</p>
    
    <p>I visit the diary of the deceased often.</p>
    <p>So it shan't be.</p>
    
    <p>I want to explore the forest west of the castle.</p>
    <p>It is quite bothersome.</p>
    <p>Yet to have found reason.</p>
       
    <p>I have journied once far west of the castle.</p>
    <p>Only curious of course.</p>
    <p>Til’ I laid eyes on the forest.</p> 
    
    <p>I wonder what it hides?</p>   
    <p>Nothing?</p>
    <p>Charm?</p>
    <p>I will not know unless I gather my legs and feet</p>
    <p>To leave the castle.</p>
