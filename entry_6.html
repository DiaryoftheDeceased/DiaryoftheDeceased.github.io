    <h2>Entry 6</h2> <h3>4•9•2024•2:25am</h3>

    <p>A day ago a celestial event occurred.</p>
    <p>From the castle</p>
    <p>My eyes witness the sun and the moon cross paths.</p>
    
    <p>It was magical and unsettling.</p>
    <p>After this celestial event</p>
    
    <p>Only an oracle can tell.</p>
    <p>I may visit my friendly stranger where the Heliotropes are.</p>
       
    <p>They keep appearing in sleep.</p>
    <p>Secretly I wish it to cease.</p>
    <p>I do not like peeking their life.</p> 
    <p>Conversing is a penny to none.</p>   
    <p>I will speak and then leave for another while.</p>
    
    <p>I am unknowledgeable on how to stop it.</p>
    <p>My forte is spirits.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I may have to endure.</p>
