    <h2>Entry 6</h2> <h3>4•8•2024•2:25am</h3>

    <p>Yesterday was a celestial event.</p>
    <p>I got to see the sun and the moon cross paths.</p>
    
    <p>It was magical and unsettling.</p>
    <p>What’s to come after the celestial event</p>
    
    <p>Only an oracle can tell.</p>
    <p>I may visit my friendly stranger in the Heliotrope plain.</p>
       
    <p>They keep appearing in sleep.</p>
    <p>Secretly I wish it to cease.</p>
    <p>I do not wish to look into their life without permission.</p> 
    <p>Conversing is a penny to none.</p>   
    <p>I will speak and then leave for another while.</p>

    <p>It displeases me that my friendly stranger is always in the Heliotrope plain.</p>
    <p>Than in the waking.</p>
    
    <p>I am unknowledgeable on how to stop it.</p>
    <p>My forte is spirits.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I may just have to suffer.</p>
