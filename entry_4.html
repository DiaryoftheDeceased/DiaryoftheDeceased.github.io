    <h2>Entry 4</h2> <h3>4•4•2024•4:52am</h3>

    <p>In the castle is fine.</p>
    <p>Yesterday was once in forever.</p>
    
    <p>The dark fog arrived.</p>
    <p>Then the silhouettes wandered into the castle.</p>
    
    <p>The silhouettes whispered:</p>
    <p>“Come play with us. You know who we are. Grab the daggers and swords. Together, let us go to another realm.”</p>
       
    <p>It's a miracle I had not listen.</p>
    <p>Had I, I would have been back at the playground again.</p>
    
    <p>It's a place I have worked so hard at escaping.</p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes I worry if I will ever close the gate to the playground.</p>
