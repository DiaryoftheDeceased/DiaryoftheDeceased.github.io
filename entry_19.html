    <h2>Entry 19</h2> <h3>4•26•2024•2:04am</h3>

    <p>In my life,</p>
    <p>Nothing is new.</p>
    <p>I do not need an oracle to tell me</p>
    <p>I would see her again.</p>
    <p>Yet I wish she had died,</p>
    <p>When I unsuccessfully killed her.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She stares and paces.</p>
    <p>We were close as children.</p>
    <p>I changed and wanted her dead.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“You are not going to speak a word to me?”</p>
    <p>She tells.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5px;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I have nothing to say to her.</p>
    <p>We are no longer alike.</p>
    <p>Like a knife to flesh.</p>
    <p>Such is life and death,</p>
    <p>When you have a body.</p>
</body>
