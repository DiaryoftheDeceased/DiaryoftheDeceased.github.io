    <h2>Entry 12</h2> <h3>4•20•2024•6:43pm</h3>

    <p>I yearn to give words to someone.</p>
    <p>That of my world</p>
    <p>Though I worry</p>
    <p>For they may not understand.</p>
    <p>Or believe.</p>
    <p>I say it is not a problem.</p>
    <p>Yet being formed</p>
    <p>Around formless soulettes.</p>
    <p>One has formed in this realm.</p>
    <p>How far they have traveled.</p>   
    <p>Only to have a name</p>
    <p>A gift</p>
    <p>Beauty</p>
    <p>As well as darkness they keep leashed.</p>
