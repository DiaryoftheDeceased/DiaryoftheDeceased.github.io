                    <p>The cosmos will not unhand me.</p>
                    <p>I am slow to anger,</p>
                    <p>Yet this dilemma has used its feet to run on a course.</p>
                    <p>I have been trapped for days.</p>
                    <p>I have not seen my castle, Mara, or the sky.</p>
                    <p>This is getting concerning</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Dreams repeatedly showing,</p>
                    <p>Watching from afar.</p>
                    <p>My friendly stranger,</p>
                    <p>Not being seen.</p>
                    <p>Over and over again.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I know the lesson.</p>
                    <p>I am drained.</p> 
                    <p>I can only imagine,</p>
                    <p>how much essense I have lost in the waking.</p>
                    <p>I have wandered the modern realm.</p>
                    <p>For me,</p>
                    <p>This is dangerous.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>To be gone for so long.</p>
                    <p>I do not crack in other realms but my own.</p>
                    <p>Am I a ghost?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I need to think.</p>
                    <p>I have not yet to leave.</p>
                    <p>I turn to the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>No.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If the cosmos will not let me leave,</p>
                    <p>It will not help me leave.</p> 
                    <p>I walk the area.</p> 
                    <p>I come across a field.</p>   
                    <p>Littered with this realms signature.</p>
                    <p>You can see the moon & the sun.</p>
                    <p>Purple.</p>
                    <p>Blue.</p>  
                    <p>Pink.</p>
                    <p>Orange.</p> 
                    <p>All share the same sky.</p> 
                    <p>The stars.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The stars are the way home.</p>   
                    <p>The stars have been used for centuries.</p>
                    <p>To trace the sky's memories,</p>
                    <p>Is to trace one’s path home.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I need to find my stars.</p>
                    <p>I lay in the field.</p>
                    <p>I close my eyes.</p>
                    <p>I meditate.</p> 
                    <p>I speak the spell.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I become my ethel.</p> 
                    <p>My noble form.</p>   
                    <p>My highest form.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Here,</p>  
                    <p>I am honest.</p>
                    <p>Here,</p> 
                    <p>I know I will get the definite truth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I am bask in gold and pearls.</p>   
                    <p>I wear a small gown that is of linen.</p>
                    <p>White.</p>
                    <p>A hue I admire.</p> 
                    <p>Here,</p>
                    <p>I do not need aid for my sight.</p>
                    <p>I have three eyes,</p>
                    <p>Six wings,</p>
                    <p>the darkest hue that sparkles white.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>It feels divine to be.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Matte Gold waters and opalescent clouds.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One would think heaven.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I think true.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Leap to and from stone in the water.</p>
                    <p>I look up,</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I think.</p>
                    <p>“Why do you show me the same storie repeatedly?”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A loud ringing.</p>
                    <p>My ears weep.</p>
                    <p>It shakes the area.</p>
                    <p>It shakes the spirit.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>“FIND WHO YOU ARE.</p>
                    <p>LETTING GO.</p>
                    <p>YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE TRUE.</p>
                    <p>THIS HAS TO BE.</p>
                    <p>THE NEXT CHAPTER IS READY SET FORTH.</p>
                    <p>IT IS YOU WHO ALL WAIT.”</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The ringing ceases.</p>
                    <p>I am whisked back to the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I have received what I have already been told.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I start to run.</p>
                    <p>I become like a horse.</p>
                    <p>The winds aid my legs</p>
                    <p>I dash to the nearest ledge,</p>
                    <p>I jump.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>It is about a building high.</p>
                    <p>In mid air,</p>
                    <p>With my back to the earth.</p>
                    <p>I close my eyes.</p>
                    <p>I should be awake now.</p>
