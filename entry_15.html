    <h2>Entry 15</h2> <h3>4•22•2024•4:48am</h3>

    <p>The castle is flooding.</p>
    <p>I can not swim.</p>
    <p>Locked doors.</p>
    <p>Not by Panic.</p>
    <p>But by someone else.</p>
    <p>I can not flee as I would like.</p>
    <p>The water is rising.</p>
    <p>I looked out the window to see where the Heliotropes are.</p>
    <p>The flowers are gone.</p>  
    <p>The water is in my chest now.</p>
    <p>I cannot escape.</p>
    <p>This is my fate.</p>
    <p>I may drown.</p>
