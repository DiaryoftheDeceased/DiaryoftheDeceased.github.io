    <h2>Delicately Freed</h2>
    <p>The loved for one</p>
    <p>All their flaws</p>
    <p>The love</p>
    <p>The hate</p>
    <p>Meeting now</p>
    <p>I won't recognize you</p>
       
    <p>Your face is vacant in life</p>
    <p>The memories are a jail sentence</p>
    <p>And time is bail</p> 
    <p>You're gone, are you coming back?</p>
       
    <p>There is poison in the heart</p>
    <p>There isnâ€™t any remedy to mend</p>
    <p>Let honesty be the coach</p>
    <p>Pride is the winner & we are not the victors</p>
    <p>Conversing with silence</p>
       
    <p>Being so fragile, so small</p>
    <p>Looking out in the world</p>
    <p>Thinking I have saved myself</p>
    <p>So delicately, delicate</p>
    <p>Even though I am freed, I am still ruined.</p>
</body>
